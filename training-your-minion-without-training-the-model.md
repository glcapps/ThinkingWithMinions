The word “training” is overused when it comes to AI. Most businesses don’t need to train a model. They need to *prepare* it—give it structure, give it references, give it purpose.

Let’s reframe “training” as something closer to **onboarding**.

## Think Configuration, Not Computation

When you hear that a model was “trained,” it usually means millions of dollars in compute, massive datasets, and specialized infrastructure.

That’s not what businesses need.

Businesses need to:
- Provide consistent context
- Build prompt libraries
- Offer structured examples
- Shape workflows around model strengths

This is like giving a new employee a handbook, FAQs, cheat sheets, and some examples. You didn’t rewire their brain—you just set them up to succeed.

## Tools That Feel Like Training (But Aren’t)

There are emerging ways to customize model behavior without touching weights or doing real training:
- **System prompts**: Define default behavior
- **Embeddings**: Attach related documents or vector databases
- **Memory slots**: Persist business knowledge across sessions
- **Function calling / tools**: Give the model real capabilities
- **Agentic scaffolding**: Structure multi-step reasoning around custom business logic

None of these require retraining the model. They just give the minion the right gear.

## Good Onboarding Is Reusable

The advantage of this approach is that it scales. Once you design a good onboarding flow (with documents, reference tables, and sample prompts), you can:
- Share it with coworkers
- Use it across assistants or plugins
- Update it incrementally
- Apply it to future models or tools

## When *Would* You Train?

Actual model training might make sense if:
- You’re dealing with massive proprietary data
- You want your own model hosted internally
- You’re targeting highly niche language or workflows

But most businesses shouldn’t start here.

## Summary

You don’t need to retrain the brain—you just need to brief it well.

Train your minion by *setting the stage*, not by rewriting the script. Think of it as onboarding a fast learner, not engineering a whole new mind.
