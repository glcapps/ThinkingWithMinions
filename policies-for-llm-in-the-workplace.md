# Policies for LLM Use in the Workplace

As large language models become more embedded in daily workflows, organizations need to clarify expectations and boundaries. A useful policy is not about locking things down—it is about enabling productive use with clear, shared guardrails.

## Why Policy Matters

Without policy, LLMs create:
- Ambiguity around data handling and disclosure
- Inconsistent usage across teams and roles
- Increased likelihood of personal accounts being used for work tasks
- Unclear expectations around accuracy, review, and accountability

A good policy reduces risk, increases consistency, and builds trust.

## Core Principles to Cover

1. **Privacy and Confidentiality**
   - Restrict use of sensitive data in public LLM tools unless explicitly approved.
   - Clarify which data types are allowed with which tools.

2. **Approved Tools and Accounts**
   - Require business accounts for any LLM-related work.
   - Discourage or technically restrict personal account use for company content where feasible.

3. **Disclosure and Oversight**
   - Encourage labeling or logging of LLM-assisted content where practical.
   - Require human review before LLM-generated work is published or acted on.

4. **Security**
   - Review provider policies to understand data retention, training usage, and access controls.
   - Prefer vendors offering data isolation, encryption, and opt-outs from model training.

5. **Training and Literacy**
   - Teach staff what LLMs are good at, where they struggle, and where human judgment remains essential.
   - Provide guidance on prompt framing, context limits, review practices, and bias awareness.

## Cultural Signals

A policy isn’t just rules—it’s a signal. It tells employees:
- “We expect you to use this.”
- “We’ll help you do it well.”
- “We care about getting this right.”

Policies framed primarily around fear tend to push usage into the shadows. Policies that support thoughtful adoption create more consistent and confident teams.

## Summary

Don’t wait until something breaks to define expectations. Establish a policy that supports experimentation while protecting the business.

If you think of LLMs as minions—helpful, task-oriented assistants—a clear user manual helps everyone understand how and when to use them well.
