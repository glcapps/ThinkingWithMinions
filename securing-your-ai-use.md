## Securing Your AI Use: Why Business Data and Personal Accounts Don’t Mix

We’ve seen this pattern before. When email first entered the workplace, many employees used personal accounts to handle work tasks. It appeared convenient and accessible. But over time, the risks became clear — and boundaries were drawn.

A similar pattern is emerging with **AI-powered applications** like ChatGPT, Claude, and others.

### Where Risk Creeps In

Many employees, excited by the usefulness of LLMs, are using their **personal AI accounts** to run business-related tasks. Employees often justify the practice by assuming the content is low-risk or temporary.

But behind that convenience are **serious risks**:

#### 📥 1. Company Data in Personal History
Content run through a personal ChatGPT or Claude account is typically saved in that user’s history unless settings are changed or content is manually removed. That means your company’s customer list, strategy plan, or sensitive financial analysis could be stored within an individual’s unmanaged personal account.

#### 🫣 2. Shared Access and Unintended Eyes
Some personal accounts are logged in on **shared or casually accessed devices**. A family member reviewing a resume or a friend borrowing a laptop could inadvertently access AI-generated records that contain confidential company prompts or results.

#### 🧾 3. No Audit Trail, No Oversight
Unlike email or internal chat, there is typically no centralized company visibility into how AI is being used. If sensitive material is shared or inappropriate results are generated, **there’s no paper trail**, no logs, and no ability to revoke access.

#### 🧠 4. Data May Leave Your Control
When you paste business information into a personal AI tool, that content is handled according to the provider’s terms and settings. In some cases, it may be retained for quality review or used to improve services unless opt‑out controls are in place. The key risk is loss of control, not intent.

### Simple Mitigations

This doesn’t mean banning AI tools. It means **setting the right boundaries**:

#### ✅ Use Managed or Org Accounts
ChatGPT and Claude offer enterprise plans where data privacy is protected, histories are not used for training, and admin visibility is possible. Where available, use these or configure equivalent privacy controls.

#### ✅ Prefer API Access with Logging
If your team is automating tasks with AI, consider using API keys tied to your business. These provide visibility, rate limiting, and log records.

#### ✅ Educate Staff on the Risks
Most misuse isn’t malicious — it’s unaware. Provide brief, practical guidance that explains what’s safe, what requires review, and when human judgment must remain in the loop.

### This Isn’t Paranoia — It’s Operational Maturity

This isn’t about fault—it’s about responsible adaptation.

As with earlier shifts like email or cloud storage, defining clear boundaries early helps avoid later cleanup.
