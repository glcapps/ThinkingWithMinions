## Securing Your AI Use: Why Business Data and Personal Accounts Don’t Mix

We’ve seen this pattern before. When email first entered the workplace, many employees used personal accounts to handle work tasks. It appeared convenient and accessible. But over time, the risks became clear — and boundaries were drawn.

A similar pattern is now unfolding with **AI-powered applications** like ChatGPT, Claude, and others.

### What’s Going Wrong?

Many employees, excited by the usefulness of LLMs, are using their **personal AI accounts** to run business-related tasks. Employees often justify the practice by assuming the content is low-risk or temporary.

But behind that convenience are **serious risks**:

#### 📥 1. Company Data in Personal History
Everything run through a personal ChatGPT or Claude account is saved in that user’s history — **permanently** unless deleted. That means your company’s customer list, strategy plan, or sensitive financial analysis could be persistently stored within an individual’s unmanaged personal account.

#### 🫣 2. Shared Access and Unintended Eyes
Many personal accounts are logged in on **shared devices**. A family member reviewing a resume or a friend borrowing a laptop could inadvertently access AI-generated records that contain confidential company prompts or results.

#### 🧾 3. No Audit Trail, No Oversight
Unlike email or internal chat, there’s no company visibility into how AI is being used. If sensitive material is shared or inappropriate results are generated, **there’s no paper trail**, no logs, and no ability to revoke access.

#### 🧠 4. You Might Be Training the Wrong Model
When you paste your business knowledge into a personal AI tool, you may be unintentionally contributing proprietary content to external training pipelines. That’s how many free-tier tools operate. Your proprietary insight becomes someone else’s training data.

### Simple Mitigations

This doesn’t mean banning AI tools. It means **setting the right boundaries**:

#### ✅ Use Managed or Org Accounts
ChatGPT and Claude offer enterprise plans where data privacy is protected, histories are not used for training, and admin visibility is possible. Use these.

#### ✅ Prefer API Access with Logging
If your team is automating tasks with AI, consider using API keys tied to your business. These provide visibility, rate limiting, and log records.

#### ✅ Educate Staff on the Risks
Most misuse isn’t malicious — it’s unaware. Provide brief, practical guidance sessions or share internal policy reminders explaining what’s safe and what’s not.

### This Isn’t Paranoia — It’s Maturity

This isn’t about fault—it’s about responsible adaptation.

But just like the early days of personal email or cloud storage, it’s time to define new boundaries.
