Most tools are useful precisely because of their limits. LLMs—those versatile minions we keep referring to—are no different. But their failures, when misunderstood, create either disappointment or overreaction. This article aims to demystify their flubs and show how failure often points toward better usage rather than abandonment.

## Not Lies, But Confident Placeholders

An LLM doesn't *know* it's wrong. It generates based on probability and pattern, not truth. When it confidently outputs something false, it’s not lying—it’s completing a pattern without grounding. Think of it like someone who finishes your sentence… just incorrectly.

In business terms: if you ask your assistant to "make up an example" without clarification, and it does so with style but not substance, it’s doing its job badly—but in the structure you gave it.

## The Disappearing Context

Most models forget. They don’t persist memory across interactions, unless you specifically build that feature. Context size is a hard limit, and what falls off the back of the conversation is gone. Asking it to "remember what I said earlier" doesn’t work unless it was in the window of current input.

This kind of failure looks like flakiness—but it’s really a tradeoff. Keeping everything forever is costly and noisy. The better strategy is: feed it what it needs, every time. Build workflows that do this automatically.

## Over-Polishing: When Too Much Help Hurts

Sometimes LLMs will “fix” things you didn’t ask it to—especially when given unclear instructions. It might over-simplify a legal clause or turn a carefully ambiguous statement into something definite. This is a subtle failure: obedience turned into assumption.

These failures arise from unclear prompting. Like any intern, it benefits from structure, scope, and intention.

## The Hallucination Problem

Yes, sometimes the minion makes things up. Fake citations, imagined features, false product names. These hallucinations aren’t bugs—they’re misuses. When we don’t constrain the task properly or forget to provide reliable references, we’re inviting the model to “fill in the blanks.”

The right fix isn’t hoping for a perfect model. It’s rethinking the prompt and the source material. Ask yourself: should this be a reference task, not a generative one?

## When It Fails – Ask What the Setup Was

Every failure can become feedback on your system. Was the context clear enough? Was the role defined? Was the format tightly scoped? If not, the minion will guess—and guessing is what causes failure.

Failures aren’t reasons to give up. They’re pointers to how to design better scaffolding.
