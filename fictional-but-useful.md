# Fictional Case Study: The Trial Run at Brightline Logistics

*Note: This case study is entirely hypothetical. It is meant to illustrate how a small business might begin exploring LLM tools in a realistic, non-technical way.*

---

## Context

Brightline Logistics is a 12-person freight coordination company operating out of Kansas City. They saw themselves as practical, not technical—but after one team member showed off a few ChatGPT results during a meeting, curiosity grew.

Their problem?  
They were overwhelmed by the amount of regulatory notices and safety bulletins that arrived weekly from different transport agencies. These were long, dry, and often duplicated across documents.

The operations manager, Kara, wondered aloud, “Could we have one of these minion tools just summarize the bulletins and tell us if anything changed?”

---

## Phase One: Naive Optimism

They signed up for ChatGPT Team with four users and picked one weekly bulletin as a test case. Kara pasted the whole thing into the chat window and asked:

> “Summarize this in 3 bullet points.”

The result? A mostly generic paraphrase. Not wrong, but not helpful either.

They laughed it off and said, “Maybe the minions need clearer instructions.”

---

## Phase Two: Clarifying the Role

One team member, Devin, remembered something from a podcast: “You have to approach the minions like colleagues—give them clear, structured input.”

So they tried again. This time, they wrote:

> “You are assisting a freight coordinator. Please identify changes in federal highway safety policy based on this bulletin. Focus only on differences from the previous week.”

They also pasted a structured snippet of the previous week’s bulletin.

The results were dramatically better. The minion ignored fluff and focused on a changed deadline and a new signage rule.

---

## Phase Three: Structured Context

By week three, they’d created a simple format:

```markdown
## Bulletin This Week:
(pasted text)

## Last Week’s Policy:
(pasted summary)

## Task:
List only new rules or revised deadlines. Respond in bullet form for the ops team.
```

They called this their “briefing frame.” It became a reusable shell that helped guide the minion.

Kara said, “It’s not automatic brilliance, but it’s reliably useful. And more importantly — it doesn’t forget things like I do.”

## Reflections

Brightline never set out to be early adopters. They didn’t know what RAG was. They didn’t write code or integrate systems.

But by thinking with minions, and treating prompts more like instructions for a smart but literal assistant, they turned a 90-minute weekly task into a 15-minute review—without sacrificing accuracy or oversight.

They now use similar templates for:
- Onboarding email preparatioßn
- Internal SOP reviews
- Customer-facing delay notifications

They still read the minion’s output — but they now trust it enough to *start there*.

## The Takeaway

The future isn’t about automating everything.  
It’s about giving people a way to manage complexity without burnout.

Brightline’s story shows that even a small team, with no engineering background, can make practical, confident use of LLMs — not by “prompt engineering,” but by **collaborative delegation.**

This isn’t about hype. It’s about adapting tools that support thoughtful, sustainable work.
