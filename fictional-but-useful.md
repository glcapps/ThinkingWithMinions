## Fictional Case Study: The Trial Run at Brightline Logistics

*Note: This case study is entirely hypothetical. It is meant to illustrate how a small business might begin exploring LLM tools in a realistic, non-technical way.*

---

### Context

Brightline Logistics is a 12-person freight coordination company operating out of Kansas City. They saw themselves as practical, not technical—but after one team member showed off a few ChatGPT results during a meeting, curiosity grew.

Their problem?  
They were overwhelmed by the amount of regulatory notices and safety bulletins that arrived weekly from different transport agencies. These were long, dry, and often duplicated across documents.

The operations manager, Kara, wondered aloud, “Could we use one of these tools to summarize the bulletins and flag anything that appears different from last week?”

---

### Phase One: Initial Expectations

They signed up for ChatGPT Team with four users and picked one weekly bulletin as a test case. Kara pasted the whole thing into the chat window and asked:

> “Summarize this in 3 bullet points.”

The result? A mostly generic paraphrase. Not wrong, but not helpful either.

They laughed it off and said, “Maybe our instructions were too vague.”

---

### Phase Two: Clarifying the Task

One team member, Devin, remembered something from a podcast: “You have to be explicit about the task and the constraints—structure matters.”

So they tried again, focusing on task scope and constraints:

> “You are assisting a freight coordinator. Please identify changes in federal highway safety policy based on this bulletin. Focus only on differences from the previous week.”

They also pasted a structured snippet of the previous week’s bulletin.

The results were dramatically better. The minion ignored fluff and focused on a changed deadline and a new signage rule.

---

### Phase Three: Reusable Structure

By week three, they’d created a simple format:

```markdown
## Bulletin This Week:
(pasted text)

## Last Week’s Policy:
(pasted summary)

## Task:
List only new rules or revised deadlines. Respond in bullet form for the ops team.
```

They called this their “briefing frame.” It became a reusable structure that guided the task reliably.

Kara said, “It’s not automatic brilliance, but it’s reliably useful. And because the structure is explicit, nothing important is silently dropped.”

### Reflections

Brightline never set out to be early adopters. They didn’t know what RAG was. They didn’t write code or integrate systems.

But by thinking in terms of delegated tasks, and treating prompts as written instructions with clear scope and review, they turned a 90-minute weekly task into a 15-minute review—without sacrificing accuracy or oversight.

They now use similar templates for:
- Onboarding email preparation
- Internal SOP reviews
- Customer-facing delay notifications

They still reviewed the output — but they now trusted the structure enough to *start there*.

### The Takeaway

The future isn’t about automating everything.  
It’s about giving people a way to manage complexity without burnout.

Brightline’s story shows that even a small team, with no engineering background, can make practical, confident use of LLMs — not by clever prompting, but by **explicit delegation, structure, and review.**

This isn’t about hype. It’s about adapting tools that support thoughtful, sustainable work.
