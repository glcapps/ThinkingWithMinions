## Timeline: The Emergence of Useful Minions

> From novelty to necessity — how LLM-powered helpers became embedded in everyday work.

---

### 📍 Late 2022 – The Awakening
- **ChatGPT becomes widely available**
- Business professionals encounter LLMs not through whitepapers but through conversations
- First signs of utility: drafting emails, brainstorming ideas, summarizing documents
- ❝Wait, this actually works?❞ becomes the spark

---

### 🚀 Early–Mid 2023 – The Tipping Point
- Explosion of interest across industries, including small businesses
- **Plugins for ChatGPT** begin to show workflow potential (e.g. browsing, code interpretation)
- **APIs become usable by non-specialists** through low-code/no-code tools
- Surge of AI-adjacent roles in org charts: prompt specialists, AI liaisons, early LLM integrators

---

### 🧠 Late 2023 – The Infrastructure Layer Appears
- Widespread experimentation with **agentic systems** and **vector search tools**
- Rise of “bring your docs to the model” workflows
- Early, exploratory versions of **Model Context Protocols (MCP)** and memory-enhanced chat interfaces
- First serious attempts to align LLMs with business logic and task structure

---

### 🛠️ Early 2024 – Tooling Matures
- Fireworks, Groq, and others offer hosted open models at practical speeds and prices
- **Desktop minions** arrive: ChatGPT app integrates with system clipboard, terminal, IDEs
- **Developers create plugins for CRMs, spreadsheets, IDEs, and chat systems**
- Internal tools quietly become AI-infused

---

### 📂 Mid–Late 2024 – Quiet Embedding
- AI moves inside workflows, not next to them
- Business software starts shipping with built-in assistants by default
- Claude on desktop explores **MCP as a native user capability**
- Assistance becomes closer to the work, easier to invoke, and less theatrical

---

### 🤝 2025 – Delegation Becomes Common
- Agents and memory features support **task threads** that persist context across sessions
- Some team workflows begin to incorporate human-plus-tool delegation patterns
- Phrases like “I’ll have the minion draft it” enter everyday language in some orgs
- Business leaders increasingly budget for AI utility alongside other productivity tools

---

### 🔄 2026 and Beyond – Normalization and Differentiation
- AI assistance becomes expected in many tools, but varies widely in quality and reliability
- Differentiation shifts from *having* AI to *how well it is integrated*
- Attention moves from novelty to governance, cost control, and task fit
- Teams become more selective about when minions help — and when they get in the way
