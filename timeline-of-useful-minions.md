---

## 🚀 Early–Mid 2023 – The Tipping Point
- Explosion of interest across industries, including small businesses
- **Plugins for ChatGPT** begin to show workflow potential (e.g. browsing, code interpretation)
- **APIs become usable by non-specialists** through low-code/no-code tools
- Surge of AI “adjacent” roles in org charts: prompt specialists, AI liaisons, LLM integrators

## 🧠 Late 2023 – The Infrastructure Layer Appears
- Widespread experimentation with **agentic systems** and **vector search tools**
- Rise of “bring your docs to the model” workflows
- Early versions of **Model Context Protocols (MCP)** and memory-enhanced chat interfaces
- First serious attempts to align LLMs with business logic and task structure

## 🛠️ Early 2024 – Tooling Matures
- Fireworks, Groq, and others offer hosted open models at practical speeds and prices

## 📂 Mid–Late 2024 – Quiet Embedding
