# Explain This Commit Like I’m a Stakeholder

It’s not enough to write a clear commit message. Not when your organization is working alongside large language models. Now the question becomes:

Can your commit message explain the change in terms that an assistant—or a stakeholder—can work with?

## The Problem with Standard Commit Messages

Traditional commit messages focus on the *what*:

> “Fix null pointer in user lookup”

That’s fine for someone reading the Git history. But it’s not enough for a project manager asking, “Why did this happen?” or for an LLM assistant summarizing progress for a weekly report.

## Richer Context in Commits

Stakeholder-grade commit messages should include:

- **What changed** — as usual
- **Why it changed** — what broke, what insight triggered it
- **What it impacts** — downstream systems, UI, reports, etc.
- **How it was tested** — in simple language

This doesn’t have to be long. Just deliberate.

> “Fix null pointer in user lookup by ensuring default group assignment. This was breaking new user onboarding. Impacts registration flow and admin dashboard metrics. Covered by updated registration tests.”

That’s a message a tool can summarize, explain, and even *revert intelligently* if needed.

## Assistants Read Your Git Log

Increasingly, developer assistants use Git logs for:

- Changelog generation
- Summarizing work for standups
- Writing internal release notes
- Explaining architectural changes to newcomers

Every commit is a chance to leave a breadcrumb.

## Think Like a Project Manager

Ask yourself: *If someone asked me what this commit was about, what would I say out loud?*

Now write *that*.

It’s a better fit for stakeholders. And it’s a better fit for your assistant, too.
