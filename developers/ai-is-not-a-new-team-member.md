# AI Is Not a New Team Member

It’s easy—tempting, even—to imagine your LLM assistant as a quirky but brilliant new colleague: one who never sleeps, never questions orders, and always has an answer. But this framing misses the mark.

The truth is: your LLM is not a person, not a hire, and not a collaborator in the traditional sense. It’s more like a well-behaved but easily confused intern crossed with a search engine and a syntax generator. If you treat it like a person, you’ll be misled. If you treat it like a tool, you can do great work.

## Human metaphors cause real problems

When developers start to believe their LLM “knows” something, or is “thinking,” their expectations shift. They get frustrated when it hallucinates. They try to get it to "admit" mistakes. They imagine it's “not trying hard enough” or “being stubborn.” These are traps.

It’s not being anything. It’s just producing language in response to language, based on likelihoods. There’s no ego, no memory (unless you build one), and no goals. Every time you ask, it starts again.

## It’s a great tool when you use it as one

That doesn’t make it useless—far from it. A well-scaffolded LLM can:

- Review a log file for unusual errors
- Rewrite a README for a non-technical stakeholder
- Sketch out a data migration strategy
- Reframe a function to be more testable
- Translate technical diagrams into bullet points

What it can’t do is own a project, follow long-term nuance, or understand your team dynamics.

## The right metaphor: a short-term apprentice

Imagine a one-day contractor who is technically skilled, very fast, and needs detailed instructions. That’s your LLM. It’s capable. It’s helpful. But it doesn’t know what you want unless you say it clearly.

Think of prompting like configuring a tool, not delegating to a mind.

## Collaboration looks different

Some of your work with an LLM will look like conversation. That’s okay. It can be conversational and still be tool use. You’re not bonding—you’re configuring.

The more you practice this frame, the better your outcomes will be. And the fewer frustrating arguments you’ll have with a machine that doesn’t argue.
