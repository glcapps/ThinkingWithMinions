# What the Model Can’t See

Large language models can be brilliant collaborators, but their brilliance has limits. Some of those limits are obvious—like not knowing what’s on your screen. Others are subtle and often overlooked by even experienced users.

This article explores the invisible boundaries of LLM reasoning, especially for developers and IT professionals who depend on context, environment, and visual cues in their work.

## No Eyes, No State

A model can’t read your terminal, your screen, or your editor window. It doesn’t see which file you’re in, which variable is highlighted, or what output just scrolled by. This is different from human collaboration, where even a glance can change everything.

If you don’t say it, the model doesn’t know it. The model might guess, but guessing isn’t knowing.

## No Memory of What You Didn’t Say

There’s a temptation to assume a model "remembers" prior work or internalizes your intent. But unless that context is included in the current conversation window—or stored in some kind of memory or retrieval system—it doesn’t exist to the model.

This matters especially when you're working across multiple sessions or switching between projects. Without the right breadcrumbs, your assistant is operating blind.

## No Real-Time Awareness

Unlike your IDE or your debugger, the model isn’t connected to the execution state of your application. It can’t tell which breakpoints are set, what your stack trace says, or what line threw the error. That has to be relayed manually, or through tools that bind model interaction to your environment.

This also means it won’t know if you’ve already solved the problem, unless you tell it. Its helpfulness depends on your updates.

## The Danger of Illusory Understanding

Models are good at sounding confident. They complete patterns. That can lead to situations where they seem to understand your problem—until their advice breaks your build.

This isn’t just a risk; it’s a design constraint. LLMs are not agents with a mental model of your work. They operate only on what they were given. Be specific. Say what you assume they already know.

## Practical Advice

- Narrate your context clearly: “I’m working on a React component that’s failing to re-render after a state update.”
- Include recent output or stack traces as text—not screenshots.
- Avoid pronouns and vague references like “this” or “that” when you mean a specific function or file.
- Think of your prompts as setting the stage. If you leave the lights off, the model works in the dark.

## Closing Thought

The model isn’t watching over your shoulder. It’s waiting to be shown. Treat it like a sharp but blindfolded partner: precise in reasoning, but entirely dependent on your cues.

Make your context visible, and the model will repay you with insight.
