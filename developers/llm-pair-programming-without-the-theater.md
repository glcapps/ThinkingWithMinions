# LLM Pair Programming Without the Theater

There’s a kind of performance art to some LLM pair programming demos: big screens, verbose prompts, constant narration. But behind the curtain, practical developers are already integrating these tools in quieter, more deliberate ways.

This article is about how to skip the theater and get straight to the utility. No standing ovations necessary.

## Forget the Monologue

You don’t need to narrate your every move or craft prompts like sonnets. Real-world use of LLMs by developers is more like pair programming with someone who’s extremely fast at typing, decent at guessing your intent, and sometimes a little overconfident.

Keep your interactions conversational and context-rich. The real skill isn’t verbosity, it’s relevance.

## Use Files, Not Just Prompts

One strength of modern IDE integration is that your minion can see your code. Use that. Highlight a block, give a short command: “Refactor this with error handling.” The file context and your brevity are enough.

And when it isn’t enough? The back-and-forth loop is fast. Use it.

## Stop Explaining Yourself (to Yourself)

You already know what you’re building. You don’t need to pitch your ideas to the AI like it’s a VC. Just give it code and your next step.

LLMs are surprisingly good at filling in the blanks—as long as you’re willing to clarify when they guess wrong.

## Build the Habits, Not the Hype

You’re not here for a revolution. You’re here for one less frustrating bug. One quicker rewrite. One helper that doesn’t sleep.

If you treat LLMs like a real partner—not a stage prop—you’ll find they’re more useful than advertised.

Just skip the theater.
