# Your First Assistant Isn’t a Genius

Your first assistant doesn’t need to be brilliant — it just needs to help. One of the biggest misconceptions developers face when getting started with large language models (LLMs) is expecting their assistant to behave like a world-class engineer, writing flawless code or understanding complex systems instantly. But the real power of an assistant isn't in genius — it’s in consistency, context, and delegation.

## Think Task, Not Talent

The first assistant you build or adopt is unlikely to surprise you with brilliance. And that’s okay. Instead, focus on giving it tasks that are simple, well-scoped, and annoying enough to be worth automating.

Examples:
- Translating error messages into plain English
- Drafting pull request descriptions from commit logs
- Summarizing API docs or RFCs
- Logging repetitive ticket comments

## Build a System, Not a Savant

A useful LLM assistant isn’t just a single chat window — it’s part of a system. Maybe it's embedded in your development workflow, your documentation portal, or your test suite. The value comes from integration, not improvisation.

You’re not trying to build the next Einstein. You’re trying to get a helpful intern who works 24/7, doesn’t mind being repetitive, and gets better as you adjust your prompts and context.

## Your Expectations Should Evolve

The first generation of assistants won’t feel magical. That’s not a failure — it’s a baseline. Over time, as you layer in context, feedback loops, and tool access, they become genuinely useful.

Start small. Document what it’s good at. Add logs. Add guardrails. Then grow from there.

That’s how useful assistants start: not by being geniuses, but by being useful.
