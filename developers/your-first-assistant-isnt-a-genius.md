# Your First Assistant Isn’t a Genius

When people first work with language-model-based tools, they often expect exceptional insight or broad understanding from the outset. That expectation obscures where these systems are actually useful.

Reliability comes from consistency, scope, and integration—not brilliance.

## Design tasks, not personalities

Value comes from assigning narrowly scoped, repeatable tasks that benefit from automation. The goal is not surprise, but dependable output.

Examples:
- Translating error messages into plain English
- Drafting pull request descriptions from commit logs
- Summarizing API docs or RFCs
- Logging repetitive ticket comments

## Build systems, not stand-ins

A useful assistant is not a single interaction surface. It is one component in a larger workflow.

Effectiveness comes from integration with code, documentation, tests, or operational processes—not from improvisation.

## Iterate deliberately

Use begins with simple capabilities. Over time, structure, context, and feedback improve results.

Document what works. Add logging and constraints. Adjust inputs based on observed behavior. Improvement comes from iteration, not assumption.

Systems become useful when their behavior is predictable, inspectable, and repeatable.
