# Think-Aloud Mode for Coders

Most developers know the feeling: you’re stuck staring at a chunk of unfamiliar logic, trying to decipher what the past version of you—or someone else entirely—was trying to accomplish. Pair programming can help, but what if your pair is an LLM?

This article explores how coders can benefit from treating language models as thinking partners, particularly through a "think-aloud" approach.

## Why Talk Through the Code?

Explaining what you’re doing, even to a rubber duck, helps you notice flaws, missing steps, and assumptions. An LLM doesn’t just sit there, though—it listens, responds, questions, and sometimes even corrects your logic. It’s like pair programming with a colleague who has infinite patience, doesn’t judge, and is available 24/7.

## What It Looks Like

Here’s what “thinking aloud” might look like in practice with a coding LLM:

> “I’m trying to add pagination here, but I’m not sure if this offset logic is safe when the data set changes between requests.”

The LLM might respond:

> “One issue could be that new records inserted between requests shift the offset. Have you considered using a cursor-based approach instead?”

The process is collaborative, but guided by your explanation. The model isn’t just guessing what you want—it’s responding to your explicit reasoning process.

## Coders at Every Level Benefit

Junior developers get clarity and a second brain. Senior developers get a chance to untangle legacy code or experiment with architectural ideas by verbalizing their reasoning. Either way, you build muscle memory for talking through problems—useful in interviews, mentoring, and high-stakes debugging.

## Tips for Maximizing This Practice

- Narrate your goal, not just your code.
- Be honest about uncertainty. LLMs shine when you say, “I don’t know.”
- Try alternating between verbal reasoning and code snippets.
- Ask the LLM to repeat back what it thinks you’re doing—you’ll spot misalignments fast.

## A New Kind of Flow State

Once you get used to it, the rhythm becomes natural. You write a bit, you talk a bit. The LLM becomes less of a tool and more of a sparring partner. The benefit isn’t just the output—it’s the clarity of thought you get along the way.

In short: don’t just type code—talk it through.
