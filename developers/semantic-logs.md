# Semantic Logs: When Output Is Your Interface

Traditional logging answers: What happened? When? Where did it go wrong?

Semantic logs ask: What *was* that? What does it *mean*? Was it *reasonable*?

In the era of LLM-driven tooling, the output isn't just for debugging—it's your primary interface for understanding, verifying, and iterating on behavior.

## From Printf to Prompt-Feedback

Developers have long used `print()` statements, log levels, and structured logs. But when your system includes or communicates with a large language model, the text it emits is the only reliable clue you have to what's going on. The semantic content *is* the behavior.

If you ask a model to summarize, explain, or route, your "log" may be:

- A paragraph of generated prose
- A JSON blob describing an inferred state
- A markdown summary handed off to the next tool

These aren't debug strings. They're functional artifacts.

## Logging as Insight, not Audit

In traditional logs, clarity is a bonus. In semantic systems, it's a requirement. You can't fix what you can't parse, and models can't help with outputs they don’t “understand” either. If you're building a system with LLMs, your logs need to be:

- Legible (to humans and models)
- Contextual
- Faithful to the interaction

Logs are no longer just a trail—they're a live, inspectable memory.

## Designing for Readability

Treat every line your system produces as if it's going to be used in a user interface—even if that UI is just you in the terminal at 2 a.m.

This means:

- Favor natural language when possible
- Use markdown or JSON if it aids downstream consumption
- Annotate with intent, not just structure

For example, instead of logging `Result: success`, consider `Task 'summarize-ticket' returned plausible summary.`

## LLM-Compatible Logs

If you want LLMs to *assist* with logs (e.g., summarize, alert, label anomalies), structure them in ways that support semantic parsing:

- Avoid dense nesting
- Use consistent field names
- Provide human-readable messages alongside structured data

A log that reads like a prompt will be easier to act on than one that reads like a stack trace.

## When Output Is All You've Got

When dealing with autonomous tools, self-healing agents, or multi-agent workflows, the semantic output is the *only* source of ground truth. Observability becomes interpretation.

In these systems, "semantic logging" isn't optional—it's the architecture.

And that means your logs might outlive your code.
