# The Postmortem Writes Itself

There’s a new kind of observer lurking in the wings of your deployments, your system outages, your Monday morning Slack threads. And it doesn't just report what happened. It remembers everything, never sleeps, and when asked, it writes.

Traditionally, postmortems are hard. Not just because the outage was painful, but because no one wants to relive the mess. Reconstructing logs, timelines, screenshots, and conversations is tedious. Finger-pointing is awkward. Language is political.

But with an LLM integrated into your environment — even passively — this begins to shift. It sees the `kubectl` flailing, the ticket escalations, the chat logs, the Jira edits. It doesn’t need to understand intent, just to absorb and summarize.

A humble LLM — even without fancy observability plugins — can help teams write their first drafts of postmortems. It remembers timestamps, who said what, and even where the real root cause started to peek through.

## Why this matters

- **Speed**: Instead of waiting a week, the first draft is there by EOD.
- **Emotion buffering**: The model writes neutrally, helping de-escalate.
- **Consistency**: It formats according to the template every time.
- **Comprehensive memory**: It pulls from more sources than any one person can.

## What to try

- Include chat transcripts in the LLM context window before asking for a postmortem summary.
- Ask for timelines, not just root cause.
- Include mitigation steps, even partial ones, to see what the model makes of them.

And don’t worry — you can still rewrite the awkward parts. But now, you don’t have to start from scratch. The postmortem practically writes itself.
