# Assistant, Interrupted

You’re in the flow. The assistant is helping. Then you realize—midway through—that it’s drifting from what you actually want. So you step in and correct it.

That isn’t failure. It’s the normal operating mode.

## The human-in-the-loop isn’t a fallback. It’s the whole point.

When people imagine “AI assistance,” they often picture smooth automation: you type a task, the assistant nails it, and you’re free to focus on higher things. Real collaboration with LLMs is iterative. Interruptions, redirections, partial completions, and clarifications aren’t errors in the process. They are the process.

## Don’t apologize. Iterate.

A lot of users feel sheepish when they change direction midstream. “Sorry, actually make it a table,” or “Wait, can you try a more casual tone?” These corrections are powerful. They tell the assistant more about what matters.

And unlike with people, interruption here is costless. Use it.

## Good tools wait for feedback

A well-designed AI system should make it easy for you to steer. That means:

- Expose intermediate output
- Allow stopping, rewinding, or revising
- Make intent and assumptions inspectable

If your assistant doesn’t handle interruption well, it’s not your fault. It’s a design flaw.

## Design for interruption

One reliable approach is to structure work so interruption is expected rather than exceptional. For example:

1. First, generate the headings for this guide.
2. Next, write a short paragraph under each.
3. Then, revise with a more playful tone.

This lets you interrupt naturally—because it builds interruption in.

## Interruption is control

If you are actively steering, correcting, shaping, and editing, you are not breaking the flow.

You are defining it.
