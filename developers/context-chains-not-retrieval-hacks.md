# Context Chains, Not Retrieval Hacks

There's a tendency to treat context in LLM workflows like RAM: shove as much data in as possible and hope the model figures it out. The popular fix? Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), where relevant documents are pulled in to give the model more to work with.

That works—sometimes. But it’s brittle. And for developers trying to build dependable systems, it's often the wrong abstraction.

## Retrieval is for documents. Context is for reasoning.

What a model needs isn’t *all the facts*—it’s *the right facts in the right order with the right framing*. That’s a different job.

Think of it this way:

- RAG is a **filing clerk** dumping documents on your desk.
- Context chaining is a **research assistant** summarizing key points, translating jargon, and surfacing what's relevant *to this moment*.

## Chain your thoughts

Instead of dumping context, build chains of prompts where each stage prepares the next:

1. Start with a **primer**: Teach the model about this project or domain.
2. Follow with **extraction**: Pull out only what’s needed from a larger source.
3. Add **focus**: Narrow down the current task and constrain the style or goal.
4. Deliver the final **action prompt**: Now the model is ready to perform.

This approach builds context *on the fly* and makes each step testable and debuggable.

## Benefits over RAG

- Works with less powerful models—because the prompt is tuned, not bloated
- Easier to observe and correct errors in understanding
- Supports progressive interaction—useful in agentic workflows
- More human-readable: every step produces output a person can understand

## When retrieval helps

To be clear: retrieval isn’t bad. It’s just one tool. Use it to *gather*, not to *explain*. Once you retrieve relevant pieces, *process them*. Summarize. Filter. Turn them into prompt-friendly formats before handing them to the model.

## Not a hack. A habit.

Context chaining isn't a trick. It's a methodology. And it mirrors how humans solve complex problems: we don’t read the whole library—we collect, digest, summarize, and iterate.

Don’t just retrieve. *Reason*.
