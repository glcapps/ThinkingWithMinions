# Budgeting for Thinking

When working with LLMs, the question is no longer just *how long will this take* but also *how much thinking do I want to buy?*

That’s not a metaphor. With usage-based pricing—especially in token-based APIs—you are literally paying for cognitive work. A longer or more complex interaction doesn’t just cost you time. It costs dollars, and the structure of your prompts directly affects the bill.

## Cheap thoughts, costly reasoning

A simple rewrite or summary may only cost a few cents. A full-context multi-part analysis with tool use, memory loops, and multiple agents? That could be several dollars.

- Token counts increase with repetition or redundant context
- Richer models cost more per token but provide more depth
- Adding structured reasoning (like planning or synthesis) increases interaction rounds

This means you need to think like an engineer, not a mystic. Good prompt architecture matters. Economy matters. But so does precision.

## Budgeting by phase

You can break AI assistance into mental budget lines:

1. **Scouting**: Asking exploratory questions or generating broad ideas
2. **Scaffolding**: Creating outlines, plans, and stepwise instructions
3. **Execution**: Doing the work—writing, rewriting, converting formats
4. **Evaluation**: Reviewing output or proposing revisions

Each phase has a different token signature. Scouting is cheap. Evaluation can get expensive if you're analyzing a big context window with high-end models.

## Think of tokens like compute cycles

Every token processed is a CPU tick of cognition. If you’re running hot for too long on a broad prompt, you’ll rack up cost without better answers. Break tasks down. Focus context. Clarify steps.

Even simple tricks—like saying “wait for me to say GO before continuing”—can prevent runaway charges when chaining interactions.

## Plan your ask, not just your answer

Before launching a prompt, ask yourself:

- Do I need the most expensive model for this?
- Can I break this task into two cheaper steps?
- Should the model *think out loud* to help me catch errors earlier?

A little forethought saves more than tokens. It improves results, too.

Budgeting for thinking isn’t stinginess. It’s strategy.
