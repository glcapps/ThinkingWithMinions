# Slow Down and Summarize

In software development, momentum often crowds out reflection: deadlines, fixes, and feature work pile up. But sometimes the most productive move a developer can make is to pause—and ask a deceptively simple question:

**"What’s this really doing?"**

This is where summarization and restatement become useful. Asking a system to explain existing behavior forces implicit logic into explicit form.

Examples include:

> “Can you walk me through the purpose of this function?”  
> “Summarize what this service does based on its methods and naming.”  
> “What’s the high-level flow here?”

These questions are not a sign of weakness. They are a way to reestablish orientation before making changes. They are the questions that clarify intent and boundaries.

Summarization is especially valuable during onboarding or handoff. Restating what a system does turns informal knowledge into artifacts that can be reviewed, revised, and shared.

Repetition is part of the process. Revisiting the same explanation from different angles often reveals gaps or assumptions that were previously unnoticed.

Deliberate summarization slows the work just enough to make progress more reliable.
