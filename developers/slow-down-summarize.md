# Slow Down and Summarize

In the fast-moving world of software development, it's easy to get swept up in the momentum: sprint deadlines, production fixes, constant feature pushes. But sometimes the most productive move a developer can make is to pause—and ask a deceptively simple question:

**"What’s this really doing?"**

That’s where LLMs shine. Not just as code-generators or rubber ducks with encyclopedic memory, but as tireless, ego-free explainers. You can ask:

> “Can you walk me through the purpose of this function?”  
> “Summarize what this service does based on its methods and naming.”  
> “What’s the high-level flow here?”

These aren’t signs of being unprepared. They're how good engineers get grounded. They’re the questions you’d ask a mentor if you had one right there. And with an LLM, you kind of do.

This isn’t just useful for you—it’s essential when onboarding someone else. Asking a model to restate what your system does turns implicit tribal knowledge into clear, reviewable artifacts. You can pass it along. You can iterate on it. You can sanity check your own assumptions.

And best of all: the model doesn’t flinch if you ask the same thing twice. Or three times. It doesn’t shame you for not knowing. Sometimes you need to ask from just the right angle to actually get it.

Let the model help you slow down—so your brain can speed up.
