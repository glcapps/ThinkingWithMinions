One of the trickiest parts of working with LLMs is their memory—or lack of it. These tools can hold thousands of words in “context” for a single prompt, but once the session ends, that memory vanishes. Or worse, loops back on itself in unexpected ways.

Let’s demystify how context windows, memory limits, and looping behavior affect the way we work with minions.

## What Is Context, Really?

“Context” in LLMs is the rolling window of tokens (words, punctuation, formatting) that the model can see at once. It’s not memory in the traditional sense. It’s more like the model’s working memory during a conversation.

Once the buffer fills up, older content gets pushed out—like a chalkboard you keep writing on. Newer input overwrites the oldest lines.

## Looping Costs Time and Money

When you use an agentic system or a looping process to keep trying or refining outputs, the system often has to resend the full context repeatedly. That means:

- **Higher token usage**  
- **Slower interactions**  
- **Possible drift in tone or logic**

If not carefully managed, your system can loop in ways that reprocess the same context unnecessarily—burning budget and patience.

## Mitigating the Limits

There are ways to design around these constraints:

- **Segmented tasks**: Break down work into smaller, less memory-intensive prompts.
- **Stateful prompts**: Pass back only essential summaries instead of the whole history.
- **Chained reasoning**: Use tools or humans to gather outputs and feed them forward intelligently.
- **External memory**: Store long-term context in structured notes or databases, and pull from them only what’s needed.

Think like a playwright, not a stenographer. Don’t try to capture the whole play in one act.

## When It’s a Feature

These limits aren’t just a flaw—they create boundaries that encourage clarity. Knowing your model forgets things means you write with more intention. You scaffold your minion’s thoughts step by step.

In the same way that Twitter’s old 140-character limit led to punchier writing, context limits can lead to smarter prompting.

## Summary

Your minion’s memory isn’t broken—it’s just short.

Design with that in mind. Keep loops efficient, prompts focused, and history externalized. The more you respect the boundaries of context, the more powerful the model becomes in use.
