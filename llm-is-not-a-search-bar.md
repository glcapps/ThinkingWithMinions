# LLMs Are Not Search Bars

When you type something into Google, you're rewarded with a list of links. When you type something into an LLM, you're speaking to a generative tool that tries to construct a plausible response based on language patterns. This is not the same thing—and confusing the two is a source of many frustrations.

## What You’re *Actually* Doing

An LLM doesn’t look things up. It doesn’t “know” facts the way a database or search engine indexes documents. It simulates language-based reasoning within the bounds of its training and the immediate context you provide.

So when you ask it “When was the Magna Carta signed?” it will probably answer correctly—but not because it searched the web. It's replaying a remembered pattern of text fragments that were statistically likely during its training. That difference matters.

## The Consequences of Misuse

Using an LLM like a search engine leads to several common failures:

- **False confidence:** It may “guess” when it doesn’t know, and present its guess with full grammatical certainty.
- **Lack of source:** There is no URL or document backing up the statement unless you structure your system to return one.
- **Inconsistency:** Ask the same question twice, get different answers.

This isn't a bug—it’s a misunderstanding of the tool.

## A Better Frame: A Writing Partner

Instead of thinking of it as a search bar, think of it like a well-read assistant who can riff on any topic, but needs clear direction. When you say: “Help me write an email about our new holiday policy,” it performs beautifully. When you say “What’s our holiday policy?” it will guess—and might guess wrong.

## Give It What It Needs

You can still get accurate and useful results from an LLM—but only if you give it structure and framing:

- Add context (paste in policy docs, summaries, examples)
- Specify output format (“make a bulleted summary”)
- Ask it to “only answer from this reference”

Treat it like a helpful but distractible intern. The more you clarify the job, the better the result.

## Summary

Search engines look up. LLMs write down.

They’re different tools, with different strengths. And if you stop treating your minion like a search bar, it will stop frustrating you—and start impressing you.
