## What a Dollar Buys in LLM Time

What if we told you that a single dollar could buy you an assistant's full attention — for the length of a task, not just a reply?

That’s what modern LLM usage now looks like in 2025. A dollar buys **minutes of intelligence**, not just a few lines of text. If used wisely, it can accomplish **an entire business chore**, not just a brainstorm.

Let’s break it down.

### 💡 One Dollar, One Task: The New Mental Model

We’re used to thinking of dollars buying hours, gigabytes, or miles. In LLM terms, your dollar buys a **slice of focused, intelligent effort**, often for a **complete task**.

Here are real-world examples by model tier:

---

### 🧮 Small Models ($0.001–$0.01 per 1K tokens)
*Examples: LLaMA 3 8B on Fireworks, DeepSeek-V3*

**Chore**: Turn an 800-word messy email thread into a clean customer summary, highlighting the timeline, issues discussed, responses, and unresolved questions.

📈 **Value**: Replaces manual account management prep; improves clarity for support and follow-up  

---

### 📊 Medium Models ($0.03–$0.15 per 1K tokens)
*Examples: Claude Sonnet, GPT-3.5 Turbo*

**Chore**: Summarize a 2-page vendor contract into a plain-English email that highlights key obligations, options, and renewal conditions for a client stakeholder.

📈 **Value**: Speeds up internal and external communication of legal/ops content  

---

### 🧠 High-End Models (GPT-4 Turbo, Claude Opus)
*Costs: GPT-4 Turbo at ~$0.01 in / $0.03 out; Opus at ~$15/million tokens*

**Chore**: Given a formal customer complaint and 3 previous support logs (~3,000 words), generate an empathetic resolution email and an internal summary note with flagged risks.

📈 **Value**: Synthesizes complex history into action-ready communication

### 🧠 It’s Not About Token Count — It’s About Value

A dollar spent on the right model for the right task is often a **force multiplier**:

- 💼 Saves meetings
- 📎 Streamlines onboarding
- ✍️ Drafts high-quality artifacts
- 🧭 Informs better decisions

### 💬 Final Thought

Don’t think of your minion in terms of “how many words it can say.”  
Think in terms of:  
> **“What job can it finish?”**

With just a dollar, that job might surprise you.
