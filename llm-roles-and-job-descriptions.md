# LLM Roles and Job Descriptions

As LLMs become integral to more and more business workflows, it’s time to rethink our internal job descriptions—not just for people, but for the “minions” we now hire in silicon. What roles do these models fill? And how do we responsibly assign them tasks?

## Not Replacements—Colleagues with Limitations

First, we need to stop framing LLMs as magic replacements for workers. They aren’t here to replace your staff—they’re here to work alongside them, when used with intention and clarity. That means defining their duties as clearly as you would a junior hire.

So: what is this minion for?

## Five Common LLM “Job Titles”

1. **Draft Assistant**  
   Used to create first-pass versions of emails, reports, product descriptions, and proposals. The goal here isn’t perfection—it’s momentum.

2. **Summarizer**  
   Given transcripts, documents, or data outputs, the minion highlights key ideas, action items, or discrepancies. Best used with templated outputs.

3. **Process Explicator**  
   Able to explain workflows or policies in plainer language, useful in training or compliance review. Often paired with reference material.

4. **Transformer**  
   Used to convert content between formats—text to JSON, table to markdown, PDF to HTML, and so on. Careful prompt design required.

5. **Data Interrogator**  
   Works with structured data, logs, or business documents to extract meaning or spot issues. This role borders on analytics support but remains language-based.

## Don’t Just Say “Use AI”

A responsible business leader doesn’t tell staff to “use Google”—they teach how to search, how to evaluate sources, and when to ask a colleague instead. The same must be true with LLMs.

Each job description must include:
- The type of task it’s meant for
- The limitations of the role
- How to check or refine the output
- Escalation paths (e.g., when to defer to a human)

## Cross-Training Encouraged

Some minions can do several of these jobs in sequence, especially when integrated into workflows. But clarity is still essential. Don't expect the assistant to summarize and extract and transform and file and notify without scaffolding.

Design modular tasks. Let each “role” build on the last.

## Summary

The best use of LLMs starts with clearly defined roles. Assign your minions thoughtfully—and train your team to treat them as interns with impressive skills but definite blind spots.
