# LLM Roles and Job Descriptions

As language models become embedded in more business workflows, it is useful to define the kinds of tasks they are delegated to perform. This is not about assigning jobs or agency, but about making responsibility, scope, and review explicit.

## Not replacements—delegated capabilities

Language models are not replacements for staff, nor are they collaborators. They are delegated capabilities that operate within defined scope and constraints. Treating them as such helps prevent overreach, misplaced trust, and silent failure.

That means defining their tasks as clearly as any other system component.

So: what task is being delegated?

## Common delegated task patterns

1. **Draft generation**  
   Used to create first-pass versions of emails, reports, product descriptions, and proposals. The goal here isn’t perfection—it’s momentum.

2. **Summarization**  
   Given transcripts, documents, or data outputs, this task highlights key ideas, action items, or discrepancies. Best used with templated outputs.

3. **Process explanation**  
   Provides explanations of workflows or policies in plainer language, useful in training or compliance review. Often paired with reference material.

4. **Content transformation**  
   Converts content between formats—text to JSON, table to markdown, PDF to HTML, and so on. Careful prompt design required.

5. **Language-based data analysis**  
   Works with structured data, logs, or business documents to extract meaning or spot issues. This task borders on analytics support but remains language-based.

## Don’t Just Say “Use AI”

A responsible organization does not simply say “use AI”—they teach how to search, how to evaluate sources, and when to ask a colleague instead. The same must be true with language models.

Each delegated task definition should include:
- The type of task it’s meant for
- The limitations of the role
- How to check or refine the output
- Escalation paths (e.g., when to defer to a human)

## Cross-Training Encouraged

Some systems can support multiple task patterns in sequence when integrated into workflows. Do not expect multiple task patterns to be performed reliably without explicit sequencing and scaffolding.

Design modular tasks. Let each “role” build on the last.

## Summary

Effective use of language models starts with clearly defined task boundaries. Delegation works when scope, constraints, and review are explicit—and when responsibility remains with the people and systems that define the work.
