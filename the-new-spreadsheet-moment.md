## The New Spreadsheet Moment

In the early days of business computing, the spreadsheet didn’t just streamline accounting — it transformed how business professionals interacted with numerical analysis.

Before Excel and Lotus 1-2-3, modeling and forecasting were the exclusive domain of specialists. They used calculators, ledgers, or mainframes. Then came spreadsheets, and suddenly anyone with a question could test a scenario. Apply a formula, test a variable, and observe real-time impacts. Entire layers of approval and rework evaporated. Junior analysts outmaneuvered executives. Teams became more agile. The spreadsheet democratized modeling.

We’re now seeing a similar shift begin again — broader in scope, but familiar in feel.

### What Spreadsheets Did for Numbers, LLMs Are Doing for Language

Spreadsheets let people simulate. LLMs let people **summarize, explain, draft, and refine** language-based work — often in seconds.

You don’t need a background in analytics to use a spreadsheet today. Likewise, non-technical users can now:
- Ask questions of dense reports
- Draft follow-up emails
- Explore multiple ways to phrase a pitch
- Turn a rambling doc into a slide-ready outline

This shift means more than convenience. It’s leverage.  
Like spreadsheets, the leverage comes from making iteration cheap and visible, not from eliminating judgment.

### Flattening Hierarchies — Again

The spreadsheet gave junior employees the power to analyze without waiting. LLMs give many more people the ability to **synthesize and communicate** with greater clarity.

Interns can prep summaries that align more closely with professional standards. Middle managers can transform raw notes into polished memos. Department heads can get decision-ready drafts without facing a blank canvas.

Just as Excel empowered those willing to explore rows and formulas, LLMs tend to reward those willing to **iterate and refine**.

### Same Tensions, New Form

Early spreadsheet adoption wasn’t smooth. People feared:
- Formula errors that would cascade silently
- Unsanctioned models with faulty logic
- Displacement of roles tied to traditional reporting

LLM adoption faces similar skepticism:
- Hallucinated facts
- Superficial responses
- Reduced clarity on what the model “knows” or why it said something

Over time, we learned to validate spreadsheets. We learned to check cells, compare versions, and build audits.

We are beginning to develop parallel practices for validating LLM output.

### A Familiar Feeling

If you remember the first time Excel changed your job — you already know what’s coming.

The initial excitement, the disorientation of acceleration, the new sense of capability. It’s happening again, but with words instead of numbers.

This isn’t a one-time upgrade. It’s the emergence of a new working layer for how people handle language-heavy tasks.
