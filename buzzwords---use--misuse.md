## Buzzwords: Use & Misuse

If AI had a business card, it would say “Buzzword Factory.” The rise of large language models (LLMs) has flooded conversations with jargon — some earned, some misunderstood, some... just filler. In this article, we’ll clear the fog around the most common terms you’ve likely heard in boardrooms, brainstorms, and pitches. Let’s separate the signal from the smog.

---

### 🧠 Training  
**What it *means*:** The original, expensive process of creating a model. Billions of words. Massive infrastructure. Think of it as raising a brain from scratch.

**How it’s *misused*:** “We trained ChatGPT to write our reports.”  
No, you didn’t. You *used* ChatGPT. You may have *guided* it. But unless you're OpenAI, you're not doing training.

**Common confusion:** People think every interaction “trains” the model. It doesn’t. That's called prompting — and the model forgets it as soon as you close the tab.

---

### 🔧 Fine-Tuning  
**What it *means*:** Taking a pre-trained model and adjusting it slightly to specialize it. Like teaching a fluent speaker technical jargon for your industry.

**How it’s *misused*:** “Let’s fine-tune it with some emails.”  
Unless you’ve got engineers, GPU clusters, and $100k lying around, no — you’re probably just providing examples in a prompt.

**Common confusion:** Fine-tuning is *not* copy-pasting your company wiki into the prompt box. That’s a different kind of enhancement — and usually not necessary.

---

### 🎯 Prompt Engineering  
**What it *means*:** Designing precise instructions that help the model do what you want — especially when the stakes or complexity are high.

**How it’s *misused*:** “You just need the right prompt and it’ll solve anything.”  
Prompts matter, but they’re not magic incantations. A vague prompt plus a buzzword doesn’t equal insight.

**Common confusion:** It’s not about syntax tricks — it’s about delegation. Think of it like writing a great creative brief.

---

### 🤯 Hallucination  
**What it *means*:** When the model confidently makes things up — inventing names, dates, quotes, or just fabricating answers.

**How it’s *misused*:** “The AI lied to us!”  
No, it hallucinated. It doesn’t know truth from fiction — it’s predicting plausible sequences of words.

**Common confusion:** People expect models to be like search engines. They’re not. They’re text predictors with no grounding unless you give it to them.

---

### 📚 Context  
**What it *means*:** The total amount of information the model can “hold in mind” during a session — like working memory.

**How it’s *misused*:** “This model has lots of context, so it knows everything.”  
Nope. Context is *temporary.* Once the chat ends or the limit is hit, it’s gone.

**Common confusion:** Many assume context is infinite — but every word you add eats into the limit. Managing context is a critical skill in LLM use.

---

### 🔡 Token  
**What it *means*:** A chunk of text — not quite a word, not quite a syllable. Models read and respond in tokens. “Elephant” is one token. “Antidisestablishmentarianism” might be four.

**How it’s *misused*:** “It can read my 100-page report.”  
Not if that report is more tokens than the model’s limit. Know your model’s budget.

**Common confusion:** Tokens cost money. Every message has a price. Ignoring token counts can turn a cheap experiment into a surprise invoice.

---

### 📦 RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)  
**What it *means*:** A technique that feeds external knowledge into the model in real time — like giving it notes before it speaks.

**How it’s *misused*:** “We do RAG, so accuracy is solved.”  
RAG is helpful — but not a silver bullet. Poor documents in, poor answers out.

**Common confusion:** RAG is not search. It’s a system architecture. Just having access to files doesn’t mean the answers improve.

---

### 🤖 Smart  
**What it *means*:** …we don’t know. Depends on who’s saying it.

**How it’s *misused*:** “This is the smartest AI yet.”  
“Smart” is vague. Are we talking about creativity? Logic? Memory? Cost-efficiency? Be specific.

**Common confusion:** Bigger doesn’t mean better. Sometimes the “smarter” model gives worse answers — or just more expensive ones.

## 🚫 Buzzwords You’re Probably Misusing

- **Training:** You’re *prompting*, not training.
- **Fine-tuning:** Unless you hired a lab, you’re not.
- **Hallucination:** It’s not lying. It’s guessing.
- **Token:** Think of it like text budget, not words.
- **Smart:** Describe what you mean instead.

Buzzwords aren’t bad — they just need supervision. Like minions.
