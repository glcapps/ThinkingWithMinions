# The Office of LLMs

As language models embed themselves into business workflows, a new kind of department is emerging—not in title, but in function. It’s not IT, not HR, not Marketing, yet it touches all of them. Think of it as the **Office of LLMs**.

## What Is It?

The Office of LLMs isn’t always literal. In some businesses, it might be one power user in Operations. In others, a small cross-functional group. But the idea is the same: someone (or some team) tends the garden.

This includes:
- Coordinating use of LLM tools across departments
- Maintaining prompt libraries
- Testing tools and plugins
- Educating staff on LLM capabilities
- Building bridges between business needs and model affordances

## Why It Matters

Without a centralized perspective, LLM use can become:
- Redundant (everyone builds their own prompt for the same task)
- Risky (no shared security norms)
- Shallow (only basic uses get adopted)

The Office of LLMs helps a business **scale** its thinking. It brings order, reuse, and insight across scattered experiments.

## Responsibilities

- **Governance**: Align usage with data policy and tool access
- **Enablement**: Help teams get started, answer questions, track good examples
- **Tool Vetting**: Evaluate plugins, hosted options, and hosted models
- **Internal Research**: Stay on top of what works and what doesn’t in real tasks
- **Feedback**: Close the loop between users and model/tool developers

## Who Belongs There?

This office doesn’t need to be staffed by AI researchers. What matters is curiosity, pragmatism, and communication. Often, the best early candidates are:

- Ops leads
- Product managers
- IT support with strong interpersonal skills
- Analysts with storytelling habits
- Anyone who thinks about “how people actually work”

## Summary

You don’t need an AI department—but you probably need an Office of LLMs.

Not to centralize power, but to nurture understanding and capability. A place in the org where the minions can report for duty—and be given the right tasks.
