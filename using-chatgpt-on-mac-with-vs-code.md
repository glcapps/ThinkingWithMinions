## Using ChatGPT on Mac with VS Code

Many business users view ChatGPT primarily as a browser-based tool. A separate place where you interact with independently. But that is rapidly evolving.

The **ChatGPT macOS app** now offers a new kind of experience: one that **integrates directly into your desktop environment**, especially VS Code and Terminal. For non-coders, this may seem unfamiliar — yet it represents one of the most adaptable environments available for AI assistance.

Let’s explore how.

### VS Code: A Universal Notepad

While traditionally used by developers, VS Code also offers a versatile space for **writing, planning, and organizing** — particularly when combined with ChatGPT’s capabilities.

- **Open a Markdown or plain text file**  
  Whether you're preparing a quarterly update or capturing meeting insights, with ChatGPT alongside you can:
  - Request assistance with formatting
  - Summarize sections
  - Improve clarity or tone
  - Convert bullet points into prose

- **Use it as a workspace for unstructured thinking**  
  VS Code is responsive, clean, and neutral — it imposes no templates or formatting constraints. It serves as an ideal blank canvas for brainstorming with your AI assistant.

- **Documentation sidekick**  
  As you record ideas, you can request ChatGPT to propose headings, refine structure, or outline follow-up actions.

### Terminal and Clipboard Support

The ChatGPT macOS app also integrates with:
- **Your clipboard**: It can summarize copied text, including from applications that do not permit editing.
- **The terminal**: Useful if you employ basic scripts, though most business users may not require this — it nevertheless demonstrates the depth of integration the assistant is achieving.

### Real Use Cases (No Code Required)

Here are several examples where this setup excels for business tasks:
- ✏️ Composing an internal policy update
- 📋 Condensing meeting transcripts from collaboration tools
- 🧠 Structuring brainstorming notes into coherent next steps
- 💬 Drafting reusable reply templates for routine communications

### The Future Is Clunky — For Now

At present, the experience still involves some friction. You must manage windows, be aware of the active file, and occasionally perform more copy and paste than desired.

However, this is the **sneak peek**.

This illustrates what future AI-integrated workflows will resemble — where every application, document, and workspace includes a helpful assistant ready to support your work.

> Today’s setup is a preview—slightly awkward, but a clear signal of the integrated AI workflows to come.
