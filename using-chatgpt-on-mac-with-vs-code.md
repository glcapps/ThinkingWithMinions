## Using ChatGPT on Mac with VS Code

Many business users were first introduced to ChatGPT as a browser-based tool — a separate place you visit to ask questions or draft text. That framing is already starting to change.

The **ChatGPT macOS app** offers a different kind of experience: one that brings assistance closer to your desktop environment, including VS Code and Terminal. For non-coders, this may seem unfamiliar — yet it represents one of the most adaptable environments available for AI assistance.

Let’s explore how.

### VS Code: A Universal Notepad

While traditionally used by developers, VS Code also offers a versatile space for **writing, planning, and organizing** — particularly when combined with ChatGPT’s capabilities.

- **Open a Markdown or plain text file**  
  Whether you're preparing a quarterly update or capturing meeting insights, with ChatGPT alongside you can:
  - Request assistance with formatting
  - Summarize sections
  - Improve clarity or tone
  - Convert bullet points into prose

- **Use it as a workspace for unstructured thinking**  
  VS Code is responsive, clean, and neutral — it imposes no templates or formatting constraints. It serves as an ideal blank canvas for brainstorming with AI assistance close at hand.

- **Documentation sidekick**  
  As you record ideas, you can ask for help proposing headings, refining structure, or outlining follow-up actions.

### Terminal and Clipboard Support

The ChatGPT macOS app also integrates with:
- **Your clipboard**: It can summarize copied text, including from applications that do not permit editing.
- **The terminal**: Useful if you employ basic scripts, though many business users may not need this — it nevertheless demonstrates how deeply assistance can be integrated into everyday tools.

### The Future Is Clunky — For Now

At present, the experience still involves some friction. You must manage windows, be aware of the active file, and occasionally perform more copy and paste than desired.

However, this is the **sneak peek**.

This offers a glimpse of how AI-integrated workflows may continue to evolve — with assistance becoming easier to invoke inside the tools people already use.

> Today’s setup is a preview — slightly awkward, but a useful signal of how assistance is moving closer to everyday work.
