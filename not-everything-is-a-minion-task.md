# Not Everything Is a Minion Task

In the rush to embrace AI, it’s tempting to think every task can (or should) be handed off to a large language model. But effective use of LLMs means knowing when *not* to use them.

Sometimes, the smartest prompt is no prompt at all—and sometimes it’s a very small one.

## The Temptation to Over-Automate

Once you see how fast a minion can be at certain tasks, it’s hard not to try it on everything:
- Writing your morning email
- Creating meeting summaries
- Drafting proposals
- Even generating feedback on your own thoughts

But there’s a line between assistance and overdependence. When LLMs are used for tasks that are trivial, too ambiguous, or tightly bound to personal judgment, the results can dilute value or create unnecessary friction.

## Signals That a Task Doesn’t Fit

Ask yourself:
- Is this task mostly judgment, context, or trust?
- Is the work faster to do than to describe?
- Would the output require intense review anyway?

These are signals that the cost of explaining, reviewing, or correcting may exceed the benefit.

## Not a Shortcut for Everything

An LLM should be a power tool, not a crutch—a helpful metaphor for keeping agency and ownership where they belong. Overuse leads to:
- Unclear ownership of work
- Loss of tone and voice
- Slower iteration due to too many drafts or reformulations

Sometimes, a rough email from a person is better than a polished one produced automatically.

## Use AI Where It Adds Multipliers

Instead of using LLMs to handle everything, focus on:
- **Scaffolding**: Creating templates or starter drafts for repeated tasks
- **Synthesis**: Combining disparate data into a coherent narrative
- **Acceleration**: Getting from 30% to 80% on a task, or breaking through an early stall

## Summary

The smartest use of a minion is selective.

Don’t throw every task at the model. Focus on leverage, clarity, and trust—and recognize when the best outcome comes from doing the work directly.
