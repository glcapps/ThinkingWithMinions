# Not Everything Is a Minion Task

In the rush to embrace AI, it’s tempting to think every task can (or should) be handed off to a large language model. But effective use of LLMs means knowing when *not* to use them.

Sometimes, the smartest prompt is no prompt at all.

## The Temptation to Over-Automate

Once you see how fast and clever a minion can be, it’s hard not to try it on everything:
- Writing your morning email
- Creating meeting summaries
- Drafting proposals
- Even generating feedback on your own thoughts

But there’s a line between assistance and overdependence. When LLMs are used for tasks that are trivial, too ambiguous, or inherently human, the results can dilute value or create unnecessary friction.

## Signals That a Task Doesn’t Fit

Ask yourself:
- Is this task mostly judgment, context, or trust?
- Is the work faster to do than to describe?
- Would the output require intense review anyway?

If the answer to any of these is “yes,” consider skipping the minion. Some tasks are quicker, clearer, or more respectful if handled directly.

## Not a Shortcut for Everything

An LLM should be a power tool, not a crutch. Overuse leads to:
- Unclear ownership of work
- Loss of tone and voice
- Slower iteration due to too many drafts or reformulations

Sometimes, a rough email from a person is better than a polished one from a robot.

## Use AI Where It Adds Multipliers

Instead of using LLMs to handle everything, focus on:
- **Scaffolding**: Creating templates or starter drafts for repeated tasks
- **Synthesis**: Combining disparate data into a coherent narrative
- **Acceleration**: Getting from 30% to 80% on a task, not 0% to done

## Summary

The smartest use of a minion is selective.

Don’t throw every task at the model. Focus on leverage, clarity, and trust. And know when the best output comes from your own hands.
